Title: Soil and Chemical Substance Emission and Transport Model
Version: 2.0.1
Authors@R: person("Gerold", "Hepp", email = "gisler@hepp.cc", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: An enhanced version of the semi-empirical, spatially distributed
    emission and transport model PhosFate implemented in 'R' and 'C++'. It is 
    based on the D-infinity, but also supports the D8 flow method. The currently
    available substances are suspended solids (SS) and particulate phosphorus 
    (PP). A major feature is the allocation of substance loads entering surface 
    waters to their sources of origin, which is a basic requirement for the 
    identification of critical source areas and in consequence a cost-effective
    implementation of mitigation measures. References: Hepp et al. (2022)
